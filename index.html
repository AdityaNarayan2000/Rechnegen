              Our client had a betting platform like Dream 11. They needed to have
              secure environment and high availability so that the server does not
              goes down in any circumstances.
              <!--

                ▪ Creation of VPC, NAT Gateway, Private subnet, Public subnet etc.
                ▪ Deploying the servers on EC2.
                ▪ Configuration of Autoscaling and enabling load balancer.
                ▪ Creation of RDS in private subnet and creation of OpenVPN to
                provide secure access to the server.
                ▪ Installation of WAF and AWS Shield to impart extra security.

                successfully on AWS.

                and attacks were prevented.
